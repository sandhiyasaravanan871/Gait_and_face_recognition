Face & Gait Recognition System:
Overview:
This project is designed to authenticate individuals using Face Recognition and Gait Recognition. It enhances security by verifying a personâ€™s identity through facial features and walking patterns. The system is built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyTorch, and includes a Flask-based API for remote authentication.

Features:
Face Recognition for identity verification
Gait Recognition using MediaPipe Pose Estimation
AI-based Gait Classification using PyTorch
API Deployment using Flask & Ngrok
Image and Video Processing with OpenCV

Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, Face Recognition, MediaPipe, Dlib, PyTorch, Flask, Ngrok, NumPy, Pillow
Machine Learning: PyTorch for gait classification
Web API: Flask for remote authentication
